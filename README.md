# CPA Resources
Built with Node.js and Express, I have added all the resources that helped me excel in core courses at Seneca. 
Also, I have provided the functionality for user to add resources to this website, which had been helpful to them, in real time.

## Features
Courses API: Retrieve a list of available courses.
Resources API: Fetch resources related to a specific course and add new resources.

Static File Serving: Serves the client-side build for a single-page application (SPA).
