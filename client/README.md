Resource Management Web Application
Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON

Developed a full-stack web application for managing educational resources across different courses. The application enables users to add, view, and manage resources associated with specific courses. Key features include:

Dynamic Resource Addition: Implemented a form that allows users to add new resources with titles, URLs, and optional images. If no image URL is provided, a default image is automatically used.
Course Selection: Enhanced user experience by allowing course selection through course names instead of IDs, reducing input errors and improving usability.
Backend Integration: Built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle CRUD operations for resources. Data is stored in JSON files, and the server efficiently filters and serves data based on course selection.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed the frontend using React.js, providing a clean and responsive user interface for easy interaction with the application.
This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack development, including form handling, API development, and dynamic data management, all while maintaining a focus on user experience.
